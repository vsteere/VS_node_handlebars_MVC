# node_express_handlebars_MVC_app

This assignment uses Node.js, Express, Handlebars, and an MySQL database to create a full-stack MVC application. It is deployed to Heroku and has the JawsDB add-in to create a server connection to the MySQL Workbench GUI. 

The application allows a user to add burgers to the database, so that it is persisted, and the information is then rendered through Handlebars to the front end. On the front end, the user can click devour, to "eat" the burger, which shifts it to a different place on the page. Once it's on the second list, the user can "make another one" which shifts the burger back to the first list. 

This is done by changing a boolean variable on the backend.
